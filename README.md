# Neovim-config-lazy

After deleting my last neovim config by error using "git rm -f" i have to start from 0, the last config used packer, now that packer is no longer maintained i switch to lazy.
Maybe delete my last config was some sort of luck? Anyway it was fun take days copying and pasting configs from other aksjdkajsd
