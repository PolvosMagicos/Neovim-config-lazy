# Neovim-config-lazy

After deleting my last neovim config by error using "git rm -f" i have to start from 0, the last config used packer, now that packer is no longer maintained i switch to lazy.

Maybe delete my last config was some sort of luck? Anyway it was fun take days copying and pasting configs from other aksjdkajsd

Some features

1.- My neovim is on windows, using it on "terminal" with admin poweshell  
2.- The package manager is lazy  
3.- Lsp is managed with Mason  
4.- Tmux movements are implemented for moving between panels  
5.- Error highlighting is in floating window  
6.- It doesn't have debugger for typescript, it doesn't work and I don't know why  
7.- It have Undotree, I love that thing  
8.- Enjoy this escurumucho of plugins that I copied from somewhere else
