# Neovim-config-lazy

After deleting my last neovim config by error using "git rm -f" i have to start from 0, the last config used packer, now that packer is no longer maintained i switch to lazy.

Maybe delete my last config was some sort of luck? Anyway it was fun take days copying and pasting configs from other aksjdkajsd

## FUCK A LOT OF FUNCTIONS ON LUA FILES ARE OVERRIDEN BECAUSE I COPIED THEM FROM DIFFERENT NEOVIM CONFIGS XDDDDDDDDDD  
## I DON'T WAN'T TO DO THAT  

## Some features

1.- My neovim is on windows, using it on "terminal" with admin poweshell.  
2.- The package manager is lazy.  
3.- Lsp is managed with Mason.  
4.- Tmux movements are implemented for moving between panels.  
5.- Error highlighting is in floating window.  
6.- It doesn't have debugger for typescript, it doesn't work and I don't know why.  
7.- It have Undotree, I love that thing.  
8.- It use null-ls, it's archived since august but it works and I don't know another plugin like that.

## Languages for wich I use neovim

- C++ (main language and I think that's the only one right now XD)

Enjoy this escurumucho of plugins that I copied from somewhere else.
